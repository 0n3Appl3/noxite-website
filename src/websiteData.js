        answer: 'Naming servers with "Craft", "SMP" and "PvP" in the name is getting old. The server\'s previous name, Appl3 PvP, came from an era when factions was a trendy gameplay style. Yes, you may know the name from the Noxcrew, but this server is not associated with them.'

        answer: 'Optimistically, up to four weeks. I am very fortunate to be able to develop my own plugins, which speeds up the updating process. Although, the server also uses plugins made by other developers who may take longer to update to the latest version, so it is sometimes difficult to give an ETA.'
